# The Reference Implementation of MD5 at RFC1321.

This code is copied from:
* [RFC 1321: The MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1321).

# Remarks
The original code seems that was writtern for the IL32 C compiler.
So, the LP64 C compiler makes wrong result.

This repos patched for the LP64 C compiler.
